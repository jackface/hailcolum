 usa.1.t:0 "1932 Republican National Convention"
 usa.1.d:0 "Today is the final day of the Republican National Convention for the 1932 United States Presidential Election, while the democratic party had picked the incumbant president to lead the party into the election, we unforunatly do not have the ability to do that. The two leading contestents in the election are Charles Evan Hughes, a moderate from New York who has advocated for a status-quo in the economy and denies that government intervention is needed on a large scale. Going up against him is Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a progressive who is also from New York; advocating for some mild government action in the economy as well as electoral reform. While the outcome could end in favor of either candidate, recent polls have shown Charles Evan Hughes leading in popularity among the general population, the voting of the delegates begins soon and the new nominee will be announced."

 usa.19.t:0 "Lincoln Tomb Strike"
 usa.19.d:0 "In Springfield, Illinois at the Tomb of former president, Abraham Lincoln a group of nearly 6,000 miners and factory workers have gathered with support of the IWW as well as the Socialist United Front. They have gathered in protest to the anti-socialist and what they consider by extension anti-labor, policies that have been enacted. First the execution of Henry Wallace which they considered unconstitutional, followed by the establishment of a fake union that many are claiming have tricked them into paying union fees with no assistance from the union and now it has gotten out that our recent efforts to bribe certain socialists have gotten out. Many big faces have shown up to the event as well including Bill Haywood, John Reed, SUF leader Arthur Reimer and James P. Cannon. Some strikers who have spoken with journalists have said the Lincoln Tomb was chosen as a gathering place in celebration of the president who brought emancipation to the slaves of the 19th century, and now the emancipation of the 20th century slaves must be sparked at his tomb. This could be considered a disaster but not yet, we still have control of the situation, and the strikers have not done much but stand around with their signs at the Lincoln Tomb."
 usa.19.o1:0 "Send In The Troops"
 usa.19.o2:0 "Leave Them Be For Now"
 
 usa.20.t:0 "Failed Engagement In Springfield"
 usa.20.d:0 "Our attempt to use military force in Springfield was a failure, we did not use a large military force but how could workers and protesters defeat a well trained army? Our military forces stood face to face with the strikers until given the order to attack and once they began to attack, arrest and even kill strikers, the strikers and bystanders fought back, and the small dispatchment was defeated in a matter of hours. Now the strikers have occupied the City of Springfield including the City Hall, there are also rumors that organization is taking place in Chicago, and Peoria. If we do not act again soon all of Illinois will fall to these socialist rats as if there had not been enough of them already, and once Illinois falls we could be at risk of losing even more. We do have more soldiers standing ready to launch an attack on Springfield once the command is given and this time we will not mess up, no matter how much blood shed is needed."
 usa.20.o1:0 "More Troops"
 
 usa.21.t:0 "More Cities Fall"
 usa.21.d:0 "After our first failed engagement in Springfield we had heard rumors of people organizing in more cities such as Chicago and Peoria, now after a second engagement to take back Springfield has failed we have also lost control of the aforementioned cities due to the military located in Illinois focusing efforts on Springfield. Bill Haywood, the recently recognized leader of this revolt has announced that they are fighting to establish a socialist state within and hopefully around Illinois; Haywood's announcement means we must start focusing efforts on keeping Illinois in our hands and part of the American Union.\n\nWe have recently also been given word that the Illinois General Assembly has not fallen to the Socialists and the US army in the area has held the red scum back protecting the officials that were able to be there at the time. This has not only become a race to prevent the fall of Illinois but to protect American politicians from Anti-American activity."
 usa.21.o1:0 "Fight Goes On"
 
 usa.22.t:0 "Illinois General Assembly Falls"
 usa.22.d:0 "A shocking and sad scene today as reports have come in that the red flag has been risen above the General Assembly of Illinois replacing the flag of the state as well as the flag of our glorious nation. There has been no word on the members of government who had been hiding in the General Assembly building being protected by the army that stood on guard, all we can do for now is pray that they have not been harmed. In more alarming news we have also lost near control of the state of Illinois, as strikers or rather rebels have occupied many cities, outposts and even Scott Air Force Base. While the rebels claim to be peaceful our soldiers shall keep fighting on to them out, however it should also be known that many men in our army are backing out of the state after being ordered by General Smedley Butler to stand down and retreat from Illinois. While this order was not directly given by President Beck, it is a smart order as continuing the fight would have been very dangerous for all of us.\n\nHowever there has also been news about strikers organizing in different parts of the country now as well, including Missouri, South East Kentucky, all over New England and more. William Z. Foster, leader of the Nationalist Party has been seen leading the organization in New England, while John Reed, someone who helped with the initial strikes in Springfield has been spotted in Harlan County, Kentucky. Hopefully these new organizers do not treat the same path that Bill Haywood and the Springfield Rebels have."
