 USA_rigged_economy:0 "Ridged Economy"
 USA_rigged_economy_desc:0 "Helping prop up the Post-Great War governments of both Britain and Italy since 1912 has been very stressful on the American Economy, many government members mainly from the Liberals, Progressives and Republicans advocate for ending or adjusting the aid we send the two nations. The Federalists in power however support aiding the nations as they believe they should be helped in their time of need.\n\n On top of this, unemployment in the nation is on the rise, and the Federalists have not presented a plan to tackle it as of yet."

 USA_legacy_of_deneland_mutiny_desc:0 "The Deneland Mutiny happened in 1929, it was an organized army strike in the state of Deneland as soldiers within the army located there felt they were not being paid enough or accommodated enough for living in the northern state. When the government of Pershing refused to give any concessions to the strikers and threatened to have them charged with deserting, this lead to the soldiers staging a mutiny which echoed through the military."

 usa.1.t:0 "US 1932 Parliamentary Election"
 usa.1.d:0 "Today American voters head to the polls to vote for the new American Government as they do every 4 years. The electoral process will determine how the house of representatives will be made up until the next election, and which ever party can form the largest government will choose the Chancellor who will hold the position until the next election unless something unfortunate happens.\n\nThis election like most sees the 4 largest American political parties running against each other, the Republican Party, the Federalist Party, the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party. The Republican Party is lead by John Haynes Holmes and runs on a fabianist platform, Haynes has suggested to repeal the aid given to the governments in Britain and Italy to focus the governments money on the welfare of American citizens. The Federalist Party, the current party in power is lead by Chancellor John J. Pershing, Pershing and the Federalists advocate for a conservative line for the country to follow while also keeping the flow of money to the regimes in Europe active, Pershing in the last four years has shown to neglect the economy of the US to support those European regimes and it isn't likely an American economic crash will even stop this. Finally the Progressive Party, aligned with the Liberal Party in a planned coalition lead by Liberal Party leader, Stirling Fessenden, the coalition had been formed in mid-1931 to increase the chances of pushing both parties policies along. The Progressive-Liberal Coalition has advocated to decrease the funding to Italy and Britain while but has also mentioned they wish to reform the position of the President, they have talked about the possibility of a Semi-Presidential system under their government, something that certainly would be revolutionary to see as the American Government has been parliamentary since 1878."
