 usa.1.t:0 "The Great American Flag Debate"
 usa.1.d:0 "The debate over the national flag has gone on long enough, the founders of Modern America chose the flag due to the connections of the old flag to the military dictatorship that had been in power for nearly 60 years. This however was not seen as great by many Americans, while many supported the turn to a Parliamentary System, away from the presidential system that once stood in its place; the support for ridding of the stars and stripes wasn't as near-universally accepted. It has seen minor debate in both houses of government but had died out by the Great War and hadn't been talked about much at all again; however, that had all changed in September of 1931 when a protester against Pershing's austerity measures in response to the Munich Stock Exchange crash had been beaten and arrested for burning the Tri-Color in which Pershing had previously shown proud support of only months earlier in his Unity Day speech, it was later found that the protester was pronounced dead due to the beatings. The brutality towards/death of this protester had re-sparked the debate when protests had shown seas of the Stars and Stripes flag from the days of old as protesters flew it in solidarity for this man.\n\nWith the debate returning to national prominence many people have put forward suggestions for a new flag for America, the 3 largest contenders being The Stars and Stripes, an adapted Washington Coat of Arms as a flag, and the Marschall-Davis Proposal from during the very first flag debate of the modern era. The Stars and Stripes flag would be a return to the original flag which included thirteen stars representing the original thirteen states and thirteen stripes representing them as well. The Washington Flag as it has come to be known as is based on the Washington Family Coat of Arms which dates back to 12th century England, it has been chosen because of the obvious reason of George Washington, the first president of the United States. Finally is the Marschall-Davis Proposal, proposed by Jefferson Davis after the end of the Second Civil War during the first flag debate of many, named Marschall-Davis Proposal due to being designed by Nicola Marschall who supported the Anti-Military Government cause during the Second Civil War. Now we are in a referendum and the people must chose one of four choices given to them."
