 brazil.1.t:0 "Brazilian Presidential Elections: 1932"
 brazil.1.d:0 "Following the crash of the Munich Stock Exchange, Brazil's economy has taken a hard hit. With the President not doing anything meaningful to change the status of the economy and further cooperating with the nation’s elite the PDNB and Luis have lost any semblance of support with the public. President Luis’ flaunting of his powerful control and personal influence within the army has also contributed to the popularity loss as many fear he might use the military to keep his and the PDNB's stranglehold over Brazil's political sphere. Now the public have turned to other parties challenging Luis' rule. The most popular contender is Getúlio Vargas and the PNPB, who have most of the public's support. Vargas has stated that he is willing to do anything and everything to secure his presidency and save the country. In Second place is the NPDB and their leader, former Vice President Júlio Prestes, who was removed from office late last year after criticizing Luis' extreme cooperation with the oligarchs and denouncing him as a dictator. Many believe the reason Prestes hasn't been purged is because he would be proven right. The least popular of the candidates is Caio Prado Junior and the PNRB. Caio, despite his best efforts has failed to boost the party's popularity and is generally seen as a weak leader and the least likely to come out on top this election."
