 RUS_international_debt:0 "International Debt"

 RUS_intense_poverty:0 "Intense Poverty"

Many minorities from Jews to Turkic people must make deals to gain access to the food."
 RUS_army_in_disarray:0 "Army In Disarray"
 RUS_army_in_disarray_desc:0 "The Russian army is stuck in the days of old, using old Russian doctrines mixed with Early Great War American Doctrines which were taught however poorly understood by Russian soldiers due to lack of organization in translation.

 RUS_partial_industrialization:0 "Partial Industrialization"
 RUS_partial_industrialization_desc:0 "The steps taken to industrialization have been very minimal but to say that they are non existent is also untrue.

 RUS_powerful_orthodox_church:0 "Powerful Orthodox Church"
 RUS_powerful_orthodox_church_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church in which many Russian people love, holds some power over the ruling Junta as all members publicly support the Church. Some consider Patriarch Sergius to be a 6th member of the Junta."
